# MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.

**MatConvNet-Calvin** is a wrapper around MatConvNet that implements
the Fast R-CNN object detection by Girshick et al. ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083 ).
